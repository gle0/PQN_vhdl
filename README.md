# PQN_vhdl

**Piecewise Quadratic Neuron (PQN) model** is a spiking neuron model designed to faithfully reproduce a variety of neuronal activities with limited computational cost.
In addition, the PQN model is designed to support the efficient implementation on digital arithmetic circuits.
This repository provides a simple vhdl codes of the PQN model. These codes are incorporated into the Xilinx Vivado projects, allowing users to easily run PQN models on FPGAs.
